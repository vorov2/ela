#title What's new? (Ela Platform 2015.1)

=Overview
Ela Platform 2015.1 is a stabilization release that addresses a lot of issues in Ela, Elide and Ela standard library.
Therefore this version of platform includes a new version of Elide, Ela runtime and compiler, and an
updated standard library. Update is recommended.

=Ela changes
Ela contains a couple of critical fixes - a fix in contexts (that determine a return type of an operation) evaluation.
Previously usage of global context could cause Ela to crush. This fix affects both compiler and virtual machine.
Also Ela parser was updated and now processes multiline strings correctly.

=Elide changes
Elide goes from Alpha to Beta stage and comes with a lot of fixes including a fix in "Eval Selected" feature,
fixes in Console view and Ela Interactive view that could cause output to be formatted incorrectly, a fix that
addresses cursor flickering in the editor window, a fix for the bug in Outline view when a wrong icon could be
selected for a tree element, a fix in "Swap Clipboard" function that didn't work correctly, a fix in font 
configuration logic (wrong font could be applied), a fix that addresses a possible Elide crash when changing
cursor color and a fix that addresses a possible Elide crush when removing an entry from a recent files list
plus some minor fixes.//br
Also this version of Elide includes an updated autocomplete.

=Library changes
Ela Platform 2014.2 comes with a rewritten formatting API (string.formatfn and string.format) functions. Changes addresses
several problems introduced with the previous version of formatting. Also Ela library includes a bug fix to the datetime.fmt
function.
