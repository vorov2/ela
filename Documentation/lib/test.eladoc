A basic unit testing module.

=Functions

#regFun
Registers a given function in a list of test functions that should be executed:
>>xs = [] 
>>xs |> regFun fun1 |> regFun fun2
This function can be used to build a list with test functions. It always returns a list with
functions as a result.

#regFuns
Registers all public functions from a given module as test functions in a list `xs`.

#run
Executes all test functions from a given list and a returns a result of execution as a tuple
with a total number of executed tests and a number of failed tests.

#report pred act xs
This function generates a report of an execution result (obtained from `run`) function. The first
argument `pred` is a predicate that can be used to skip certain items in the report. For example,
the following code:
>>fmt (\(_,x,_) -> not x) writen
would output to console only failed tests. If you want to output all test results an `id` function
can be used here.//br
The second argument `act` is an output function (a `console.writen` is used for output in the
code sample above). And the last argument of this function is a test execution result, obtained by
evaluating `run` function.
