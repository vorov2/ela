This module contains generic mathematical functions. 

=Functions
#fact x
Computes the factorial function. This function infers a context automatically.

#fib 3
Returns the nth fibonacci number. This function infers a context automatically.

#fibs
An infinite list of fibonacci numbers (requires an explicit content to be dispatched):
>>>take 10 fibs ::: Int

#choose n k
Binomial coefficients function. This function infers a context automatically.

#egcd 25 5
An extension to Euclidean algorithm which computes, besides the greatest common divisor
of given integers, the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. This function
infers a context automatically.

#divrem x y
Divides two numbers and returns a remainder.

#quotrem x y
Divides two numbers (using integer division, truncated towards zero) and returns a remainder.

#/. x y
An alias for divrem function.

#primes
A list of prime numbers.

#primes'all
A lazy list of all prime numbers (requires an explicit context to be dispatched):
>>>take 10 primes'all ::: Int

#primesR
Given a range of integers by its lower and upper limit, constructs a list of all
prime numbers in that range. 

#isPrime n
Checks if a given number is a prime.

#coprime a b
Determine whether two positive integer numbers are coprime. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals 1.

#goldbach a
A Goldbach's conjecture. Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number 
greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. This function finds the two prime numbers
that sums up to a given even integer and returns a tuple with result. 

#totient a
Calculate Euler's totient function.

#pythag 12 2
Pythagorean theorem.

#vdc 2 2
Van der Corput Sequence.

#vdcseq 2
Generates an infinite list with the Van der Corput Sequence.
