#category Ela Standard Library
This module implements a simple JSON processing library that treats JSON objects as Ela records.

=JSON support in Ela
This library provides a basic support for JSON processing. As soon as JSON notation and Ela record
literals are almost identical the mapping from Ela records to JSON objects (and vice versa) is pretty
intuitive.//br
In the current version an instance of `Unit` type is translated as `null` and serialization of other data
types is controlled through `JsonAble` class.

=Types and classes

#JsonAble
This class is used to serialize Ela data types to a string that is valid in JSON document. If a type
doesn't support it, it cannot be used in a serialization context.

=Functions

#fromJsonString str
Takes a string as input with JSON document and generates a record.

#toJsonString rec
Takes a record and serializes it to a JSON string.
