Module IO contains an implementation of IO monad, IO related functions implemented
in monadic style as well as support for console IO, file IO and state mutation in monadic style
through IO monad.

=IO

#IO
This type is used to represent input and output operations. An `IO` type doesn't provide any open
constructors. You can operate with it using helper functions `mkIO` and `execIO`.
Type `IO` is a monad and provides instances for classes `Functor`, `Union`, `Pointed` and `Failure`.
For convinience this type also provides an instance for class `Show`, however applying function `show`
to an instance of this type always returns an empty string.

#mkIO a
Constructs an IO action from a given argument.

#execIO a
Executes a given IO action.

=Console IO

#putStr a
This action writes a given string to a standard output.

#putStrLn a
This action writes a given string and a new line to a standard output.

#readStr
This action reads a string from a standard output.

#put a
This action formats a given value to a string using `show` function and writes it to a standard output.

#putStrLn a
This action formats a given value to a string using `show` function and writes it and a new line to a standard output.

#readAny
This action reads a string from a standard output and converts it to a specified type using `gread` function.
>>do
>>  putStrLn "What is your height?"
>>  x <- readAny
>>  putStrLn "What is your weight?"
>>  y <- readAny
>>  let rec = x / y
>>  putStr (
>>    if rec > 2.25 then "You're too thin!"
>>    else if rec < 2 then "You're too heavy!"
>>    else "You're OK...")
>>  putStr x

=File IO
#FileMode
Specifies a mode in which file should be opened, e.g.:
  * `AppendMode` - append data to the end of the existing file
  * `CreateMode` - create a new (or truncate a file if it already exists)
  * `OpenMode` - open an already existing file
  * `OpenCreateMode` - open an alreadt existing file or create a new one if a file doesn't exist
  * `TruncateMode` - truncate an existing file to zero bytes

#FileAccess
Specifies how to share the access to the file with other programs.
  * `ReadAccess` - only reading is allowed
  * `WriteAccess` - only writing is allowed
  * `ReadWriteAccess` - both reading and writing is allowed

#openFile fn mode acc
Opens a file `fn` using the mode `mode` (specified by an instance of `FileMode` type) and access mode `acc`
(specified by an instance of `FileAccess` type).//br
This function returns a file handle that should be closed using `closeFile` function.

#readFile fn mode
This function is defined like so:
>>readFile fn mode = openFile fn mode ReadMode

#writeFile fn mode
This function is defined like so:
>>writeFile fn Mode = openFile fn mode WriteMode

#closeFile fh
Closes a file obtained by `openFile` function:
>>do
>>  fh <- openFile "c:\\test.txt" OpenMode ReadAccess
>>  closeFile fh

#readLine fh
Reads a line from a file opened by `openFile` function:
>>do
>>  fh <- openFile "c:\\test.txt" OpenMode ReadAccess
>>  line <- readLine fh
>>  closeFile fh
If a file stream is at the end position this function would return an instance of a unit.

#readAll fh
Reads all contents from a file opened by `openFile` function and returns a string:
>>do
>>  fh <- openFile "c:\\test.txt" OpenMode ReadAccess
>>  lines <- readLines fh
>>  closeFile fh

#writeStr str fh
Writes a string to a file opened by `openFile` function:
>>do
>>  fh <- openFile "c:\\test.txt" OpenMode WriteAccess
>>  writeStr "Hello, world!" fh
>>  closeFile fh

#writeLines pred xs fh
Accepts a list of values, a predicate, a file handle (obtained from `openFile` function) and writes each value from a list 
if this value satisfies the predicate as a separate line to the given file.
>>do
>>  fh <- openFile "c:\\test.txt" OpenMode WriteAccess
>>  writeLines (\_ -> true) ["123", "abc", "defg", "4567"] fh
>>  closeFile fh

#writeAllLines xs fh
This function is defined as follows:
>>writeAllLines = writeLines (\_ -> true)

#readLines pred fh
Accepts a predicator function, a file handle (obtained from `openFile` function) a reads all lines from a given file into a list
if these lines satisfy a given predicate.
>>//For a file that contains lines written in the code sample for 'writeLines' function:
>>do
>>  fh <- openFile "c:\\test.txt" OpenMode ReadAccess
>>  xs <- readLines (<>"123") fh //All lines except "123" are read
>>  closeFile fh
>>  return xs

#readAllLines fh
This function is defined as follows:
>>readAllLines = readLines (\_ -> true)

=Stateful programming

#ref x
Creates a reference cell (like in OCaml language) that can only be operated within the `IO` monad:
>>do
>>  x <- ref 12

#valueof x
Obtains a value from a reference cell, created using `ref`:
>>do
>>  x <- ref 12
>>  y <- valueof x

#mutate value rf
Mutates a reference cell `rf` by changing its value to `value`:
>>do
>>  x <- ref 12
>>  y <- mutate 14 y

#:= rf value
An alias for `mutate` function with reverse argument order:
>>do
>>  x <- ref 12
>>  y := 14
