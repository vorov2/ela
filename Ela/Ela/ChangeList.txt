0.10.4.40:Change:Comparison logic for functions have changed. Now functions are equal only if their handles are equal (they are created from the same literal form) and they are not partially applied.
0.10.4.39:Change:Built-in 'apply' function is decomissioned. Now this function is implemented directly in Ela.
0.10.4.38:Change:Now backward and forward composition are no longer built-in functions but are directly implemented in Ela prelude.

0.10.4.34:Change:Now it is not possible to use uppercased names as record names (e.g. variant literals). It is only possible when such names are quoted as strings.
0.10.4.33:Change:A generation of warning FunctionInvalidType (when a user tries to apply a non-function) is now fixed (didn't work before).

0.10.4.12:New:A new concept of type class (trait) is introduced. Traits can be declared by user and used like interfaces for custom types. In order to specify an implementation of a trait for a custom type one should use an 'instance' declaration.
0.10.4.11:New:A new concept of 'user types' is introduced. Now one can declared a custom type by using a declaration in the form 'type mytype x = x'. 
0.10.4.10:Change:Processing of module 'open' directives has changed. Now they are not processed in declaration order but are executed always before the rest of the code - you now can reference names from a module before this module is declared.
0.10.4.9:Change:A compilation model has changed. Now Ela doesn't require a forward declaration, e.g. all program bindings are considered to be mutually recursive (and self-recursive) - not only for functions but for regular values as well.
0.10.4.8:Change:Now Ela disallows shadowing of the names in global scope (however shadowing in local scope still works even for the names in the same scope).
0.10.4.7:Change:Op code Conv (used for type casting) is decomissioned and replaced by a new Cast op code.
0.10.4.6:Change:Op code Tupex (used to optimize calls of tupled functions) is now decomissioned. It could ill-behave in certain cases.
0.10.4.5:Change:Op code Has is decomissioned. It was used to test if a record has a particular field. Now compiler generates an implicit exception handling block.
0.10.4.4:Change:Op code Pat is decomissioned. It was used to test if a given value implements a particular pattern (in pattern matching sense). Now compiler generates an implicit exception handling block.
0.10.4.3:Change:Op codes Skiptl and Skiptn are decomissioned. Compiler would emit regular Tail/IsNil/Head op codes instead.
0.10.4.2:Change:Op code Elem and corresponding built-in function is decomissioned. This op code was used for optimized implementation of fst/snd functions which are now written directly in Ela.
0.10.4.1:Change:Op codes Brnil, Br_eq, Br_neq, Br_lt, Br_gt are now decomissioned. Instead compiler would emit an appropriate comparison op code and a Brtrue/Brfalse op code. The latter are the only condition branching op codes available now.
0.10.4.0:Release:Release of 0.10.4.0.
0.10.3.3:Fix:A bug fixed in marshalling of .NET functions into Ela code that have more than 4 arguments (incorrect number of arguments was determined).

0.10.2.12:Change:Implementation of 'Force' op code is optimized.
0.10.2.11:New:Layout rules for 'open' directive has changed (they are backward compatible). Now it is possible to omit 'open' keyword for multiple directives (all subsequent directives should be indented after the first or put on a single line).
0.10.2.10:Change:Layout rules for expressions in top level has changed - now multiline expressions at top level should be indented however it is possible to have multiple expressions without explicit sequencing ($).
0.10.2.9:New:Syntax for lazy blocks is simplified - parens are not always required.
0.10.2.8:Change:Now Ela allows recursive definitions in all the cases (not only for functions). This enables writing code like so: 'let a = 1::(&a)'. In some cases however a 'bottom reached' exception can be raised in run-time. This exception cannot be handled in user code.
0.10.2.7:New:Not it is possible to attach a guard to each selector in list comprehension.
0.10.2.6:New:It is now possible to specify several guards for a single entry, e.g. '|cond1 |cond2' is equivalent to '|cond1 or cond2'.
0.10.2.5:Change:Guards now cannot be chained using comma, e.g. '| cond1, cond2' is no longer valid, one should write '|cond1 and cond2'.
0.10.2.4:Fix:Using list comprehensions on a left-hand side could cause a VM stack corruption (defect #3).
0.10.2.3:Fix:A bug fixed in execution of Brtrue and Brfalse instructions on thunks (defect #2).

0.9.16.31:Change:Pushelem op code stack behavior has changed - it now processes values on a stack in a reverse order.
0.9.16.30:Change:A bug fixed in compilation logic of pattern matching for variants. A value against which a match is done can be mutated internally by an error which could cause a correct pattern to fail.
0.9.16.29:Change:An indexing syntax 'x.[y]' is now decomissioned. One should use indexing operator from prelude (:) for similar purpose.
0.9.16.28:New:Now 'where' bindings can be attached to expression at top-level.
0.9.16.27:Change:Operators '|>' and '<|' are no longer syntax but regular functions defined in Prelude. Their behavior and performance haven't changed.
0.9.16.26:Change:Syntax for 'raise' expression is simplified. Parens are now not required around error message, e.g. 'raise Failure "msg"' is valid.
0.9.16.25:Change:Assignment operator (<-) is decomissioned. Now base Ela implementation is completely pure. Support for mutation state however can be added through libraries.
0.9.16.24:Change:Records no longer support mutable fields, all record fields are always immutable.
0.9.16.23:Change:Variable resolving and referencing have been rewritten in compiler and linker. Binary format has changed as is now incompatible with old format.
0.9.16.22:New:(experimental) A new 'extends' attribute is introduced. Using this attribute one can write functions that extend already existing functions by additional pattern matchings clauses.
0.9.16.21:Change:Minor internal virtual machine optimizations.
0.9.16.20:Fix:A bug fixed in a linker - in some cases it didn't provide a file name for compiler errors.

0.9.16.15:Fix:A bug fixed in implementation of Callt op code. Sometimes when calling external function it could cause internal VM state corruption.
0.9.16.14:Change:Now concatenation operation (++) works for all data types. The default implementation is equivalent to 'show x ++ show y'. Concat for tuples, lists, etc. works differently, as it used to.
0.9.16.13:Change:Parser and compiler behavior and error messages are improved when compiling conditional structures (if/else and guards). Now compiler generates a new ElseMissing error and an AddElse hint.
0.9.16.12:Change:Now there is no separate implementation for GetField/SetField methods. They are implemented as indexers through GetValue/SetValue.
0.9.16.11:Change:Hasfld op code renamed to Has.

0.9.15.9:Fix:Many arithmetic operations on tuples are corrected to better work with thunks.
0.9.15.8:Fix:Now records support concat operator '++'. The result of this operation is a new record that contains fields from both records.
0.9.15.7:Fix:Implementation of concat operator '++' is fixed for strings - it didn't work correctly with thunks.
0.9.15.6:Fix:Implementation of concat operator '++' is fixed for thunks - it is used to work correctly only for lists.

0.9.15.4:New:Now ElaRecord implements IEnumerable.
0.9.15.3:Fix:A bug fixed in reflection (using built-in 'type' function). An isByRef field used to return incorrect results for built-in types.
0.9.15.2:Fix:A bug fixed in type checking (using 'is' pattern) for any non-standard type.
0.9.15.1:Change:Ela grammar is fixed and now it is possible to use "?" in custom operators. When an operators starts with "?" it has the higher priority.
0.9.15.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.15
0.9.14.4:Change:Comparison logic for tagged values is changed. Now exception is not raised even if tagged values are of incompatible types.
0.9.14.3:Change:Now Variant pattern can be used when declaring function by pattern matching without braces if it consists of only a tag name (e.g. let foo Int = true is now a valid declaration).
0.9.14.2:Fix:A bug in comparison logic of variants is fixed. This bug could cause VM to ill-behave when two tagged values of different types are compared.
0.9.14.1:Fix:A builting gettag function is fixed (not this function doesn't raise an exception when called for non tagged values and simply returns empty string).
0.9.14.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.14
0.9.13.1:Fix:A bug in parsing logic of function declarations fixed (e.g. let (!) 1 = 1; (!) 2 = 2 didn't work correctly).
0.9.13.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.13
0.9.12.2:Fix:Ela linker didn't work correctly in interactive environment (didn't correctly resolve names from other modules).
0.9.12.1:Change:Cast expression is now decomissioned. One should use conversion functions from Prelude (e.g. toInt, toList, etc.).
0.9.12.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.12
0.9.11.14:Change:Now it is recommended to use specific type conversion functions defined in Prelude (e.g. toInt, toList) instead of old style conversion syntax.
0.9.11.13:New:New built-in extensible conversion function 'convert' is implemented. This function accept a target type and a value to convert.
0.9.11.12:Fix:Comparing partially applicated functions which were applicated by thunks could cause a VM crush.
0.9.11.11:Fix:A variant pattern match against a thunk that has a correct variant in it could fail when it should be a success.
0.9.11.10:Fix:Implementation of Elem op code (function fst, snd, etc.) is fixed to correctly work in all situations (calculation errors, thunks, etc.).

0.9.11.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.11
0.9.10.2:Fix:Head/tail operations didn't always worked correctly on thunks (even if a thunk calculates into a linked list).
0.9.10.1:Fix:A compiler could crash (raise ICE) on certain syntax errors instead of generating a regular error message (e.g. error ELA11, followed by linker error ELA609).
0.9.10.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.10
0.9.9.1:Fix:A bug in implementation of 'reverse' logic for a linked list is fixed. Sometimes reversing a list (which happens also when list is enumerated) a bug in the 'reverse' logic could cause VM to crash.
0.9.9.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.9
0.9.8.4:Fix:Resolution of referenced modules didn't work correctly for modules restored from object files (.elaobj).
0.9.8.3:Fix:Resolution of external names (e.g. variables declared in referenced module) was broken. In some cases Ela compiler thought that a variable is imported when it wasn't the case which could cause Ela VM to crash.
0.9.8.2:Fix:A 'private' modifier for global bindings didn't work correctly.
0.9.8.1:Fix:Error in bindings using guards, e.g. "let x | y > 0 = ...". Parser didn't accept such a binding when a pattern or an operator token was used instead of regular identifier ("x" in example).
0.9.8.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.8
0.9.7.10:Fix:Error handling by Ela virtual machine is corrected.
0.9.7.9:Change:Refactorings in implementation of Ela 'lazy' data type.
0.9.7.8:Change:'NameReserved' error is no longer generated by a compiler and is decomissioned.
0.9.7.7:Fix:Chains of declarations using 'et' keyword didn't work correctly when pattern matching was used inside binging, e.g. 'x = exp1 et (y,z) = exp2'.
0.9.7.6:Fix:Fixed a bug in pattern overlapping detection for tuple patterns (e.g. patterns like '(x,y)' and '(x,y,z)' could be considered overlapping when they do not overlap).
0.9.7.5:Fix:A bug in parsing some of the operator tokens fixed (previously one operator token with the highest priority was parsed only as an unary expression).
0.9.7.4:Fix:An implementation of 'show' by lazy list is fixed. Previously it could cause VM to crash.
0.9.7.3:Fix:A compilation logic bug fixed for the lazy list comprehensions (could cause situations when a list of incorrect length is generated).
0.9.7.2:Fix:Function comparison didn't work correctly (it always evaluated to 'true').
0.9.7.1:Fix:A function call on a left hand side (when a return value is not used) not only generated a double warning but also caused VM to crash.
0.9.7.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.7
0.9.6.1:Fix:A critical bug fixed - a tail call of a thunk (not an actual function) could cause VM to crash.
0.9.6.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.6
0.9.5.9:Change:Refactoring in call routines inside Ela virtual machine.
0.9.5.8:Change:Concat operation ('++' by default) is now implemented differently by tuples - it concatenates tuples themselves.
0.9.5.7:New:Now linker performs a consistency check for the deserialized object files.
0.9.5.6:Change:Now compiler performs a name lookup (not a linker). This brings several breaking changes. Previously it wasn't possible to override a built-in in a referenced module (only locally), now built-ins can be override (all functions are can be overrided in the order in which references are processed).
0.9.5.5:New:Now module 'open' directive supports an import list with an ability to specify a visibility modifier, e.g. 'open qualified MyModule (localName=name1,name2,localName2=name3)'.
0.9.5.4:Change:Now one can use variant literal (e.g. upper case identifiers) as a record field name without quotes.
0.9.5.3:Change:Op code 'Isfun' is now decomissioned (it wasn't emitted by compiler anyway).
0.9.5.2:Change:Now functions support structural equality.
0.9.5.1:Change:A built-in 'isref' function is decomissioned along with Ceqref op code.
0.9.5.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.5

0.9.3.6:Fix:A bug fixed in call stack generation - function names weren't always determined correctly.
0.9.3.5:New:Now it is possible to open module with a qualified access only using new 'qualified' keyword, e.g. 'open qualified Foo'.
0.9.3.4:Change:Conversion routines for ElaValue/ElaObject are refactored in order to be more extensible.
0.9.3.3:Change:Now ElaLinker has an AddArgument method. This method simulates arguments using an implicit $Args module.

0.9.3.1:Fix:Arguments didn't work at all.
0.9.3.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.3
0.9.2.9:Fix:Minor corrections in implementation of Show by ElaFunction.
0.9.2.8:New:Now lists support structural comparison.
0.9.2.7:Fix:A bug in ElaList.GetLength and ElaList.GetValue fixed. They used to raise actual exceptions instead of reporting about errors through execution context (could cause Ela VM to crush).
0.9.2.6:New:Now linker generates a 'ModuleResolve' event when it can't find a module (without the DLL specified). In this case user code has an ability to manually supply an instance of a module.
0.9.2.5:Change:Refactoring in Ela linker - all 'AddModule' methods of CodeAssembly are not internal. Also public interface for the ModuleReference is cleaned up.
0.9.2.4:New:Now compiler is able to recognize builtin functions (and inline) them when they are declared using 'et' (mutual recursion).

0.9.1.16:Change:The 'base' is decomissioned.
0.9.1.15:Change:Compilation of pattern matching with guards optimized.
0.9.1.14:Change:Now redefinition of variables is not allowed in pattern matching.
0.9.1.13:Change:Now rules for mutual recursive declarations are relaxed. The work for any declarations but for regular strict binding an error will be generated if a particular bindings refer to a non-initialized value.
0.9.1.12:Fix:A bug fixed in declaration of mutually recursive functions.
0.9.1.11:New:Now Ela supports custom attribute both on module and on 'let' binding level. The first are serialized to object files and preserved in run-time, the latter can be used by external tools such as documentation generators.
0.9.1.10:Change:Refactoring in parsing of lazy expressions. Now both '(& expr )' and '( & expr)' are valid.
0.9.1.9:Change:When declaring operator in infix form it is possible to use parenthesis around operator name (or to omit parenthesis as is worked before), e.g. both 'let + x = ...' and 'let (+) x = ...' are valid.
0.9.1.8:Change:Now it is not possible to omit a variant name and to match any variant.
0.9.1.7:Change:Now variant names don't have to be prepended with an apostrophe however all variants should start with an uppercase letter.
0.9.1.6:Change:Now all regular variables (except of modules and variants) should start from the lowercase letter.
0.9.1.5:Change:Now when applying a function using infix form, e.g. x `fun` y, one can writen any literal expression (not just identifier) inside apostrophes.
0.9.1.4:Change:Now parenthesis around head/tail pattern are required everywhere except regular match construct.
0.9.1.3:New:Now one can declare functions in both infix and postfix forms.
0.9.1.2:New:Now one can use symbolic names in patterns (by enclosing them in parenthesis, e.g. 'fun (+) x y' is now valid'.
0.9.1.1:New:Now one can reference a symbolic name declared in a module (or a symbolic field in a record) using syntax 'Module.(op)'.
0.9.1.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.1
0.9.0.13:Change:Minor refactoring in strict range compilation logic.
0.9.0.12:Fix:'InvalidLazyListDefinition' run-time exception wasn't generated correctly (it cause VM to crush).
0.9.0.11:Fix:Flipping of parameters wasn't always done correctly when compiling partial applications of built-in functions.
0.9.0.10:Fix:Postfix and prefix calls for custom operators was compiled incorrectly.
0.9.0.8:Fix:'NotEqual' operation for ElaTuple was implemented incorrectly.
0.9.0.7:Fix:Pretty printer didn't generate 'inline' modifier for bindings with 'inline' modifier.
0.9.0.6:Change:Now compiler doesn't generate 'InlineOnlyFunctions' error.
0.9.0.5:Change:Now it is possible to use 'inline' modifier on non-global functions as well.
0.9.0.4:Fix:'Not' op code (and 'not' built-in function) worked correctly only with boolean types (e.g. it didn't work correctly with tuples).
0.9.0.3:Change:Tuples now no longer support bitwise operations (which was of low use anyway).
0.9.0.2:Change:Now when function is formatted to a string function name is enclosed in parenthesis if it is an operator.
0.9.0.1:Change:Now Ela function can determine its name even if there is no source code available and a module was read from an object file (works only for global functions).
0.9.0.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.9.0
0.8.6.103:Change:Now functions fst, snd, fst3 and snd3 are implemented as built-in functions.
0.8.6.102:New:New built-in functions tag and untag are implemented (when applied to a variant they return a variant tag and tagged value respectively).
0.8.6.101:Fix:Recovery of Ela machine after errors in interactive mode wasn't always done correctly.
0.8.6.100:Fix:Placeholder symbol '_' was compiled with an error.
0.8.6.99:Fix:Function call on a left-hand side could cause VM stack corruption (compilation logic error).
0.8.6.98:New:Now Ela supports inline functions through an 'inline' modifier.
0.8.6.97:Change:ElaTraits flags are decomissioned. Instead ElaPatterns flags will be used.
0.8.6.96:Change:Builtin functions 'typeid' and 'show' are decomissioned. Function 'show' will now be defined as a partially applied 'showf'.
0.8.6.95:Change:Variants are now not transparent.
0.8.6.94:Fix:Stack behavior for Newfun op code was calculated incorrectly.
0.8.6.93:Fix:Match was incorrectly compiled when a single tuple element was used as a match expression.

0.8.6.90:Fix:A bug fixed in head/tail pattern compilation logic.
0.8.6.89:Change:Compilation stage and linking stage are now overlapping. All incudles are processed exactly after an include node is found by compiler. Compiler uses metadata from compiled imported modules to decide whether it is possible to inline some of the operators.
0.8.6.88:Change:Compiler now has a setting that allows to specify the name of a module used as a Predule module (in this case no explicit import is required).
0.8.6.87:Change:An ability to define/redefine any operator added. All standard operators now will be added through 'Prelude' module.
0.8.6.86:Change:Major redesign in Ela parser and grammar. Now instead of specific operators Ela defines several tokens for operators. Priorioty and precendence is controlled by the first character (similar to OCaml/F#). Ela doesn't have built-in operators anymore except of special forms.
0.8.6.85:Change:Most of Ela operators now uses a different evaluation order (from right to left) and are no more than regular functions. Because of that sequencing operator that requires left to right order is no longer a function, but a special form.
0.8.6.84:Change:Ela multiline strings now have '<[ ... ]>' syntax.
0.8.6.83:Change:Operators '<|' and '<<' are not right associative, but '>>' is not.
0.8.6.82:Change:Minor refactoring in parsing of comprehensions (potential LL conflict in grammar is removed, no syntax changes).
0.8.6.81:New:Now implicit naming of record fields is supported when records elements are variable references, e.g. '{x,y}'.
0.8.6.80:Change:An ability to use negative numerics in pattern matching is (probably temporary) disabled.
0.8.6.79:Change:Now it is possible to declare non-global operators and to pair operators with other declarations using 'et' keyword.
0.8.6.78:Change:Pervasives engine is decomissioned (it is no longer needed with the new automatic module open procedure) along with corresponding op code and data structures. Custom operators are not treated like regular functions.
0.8.6.77:Change:Now compiler doesn't track undefined variables. Linker does.
0.8.6.76:Change:Now all module variables are imported automatically. An explicit import list is decomissioned.
0.8.6.75:Fix:A critical bug in VM fixed - pervasives (such as operators) were initialized only for the first module that referenced a module with pervasives.
0.8.6.74:New:Now Ela linker generates a warning if there is an referenced argument that wasn't supplied.
0.8.6.73:Fix:A critical bug with pervasives fixed - VM crushed in pervasives (such as operators) were used not in a main module.
0.8.6.72:New:New traits (with no corresponding logic) 'Int' and 'Real' are added to denote integer and real numbers.
0.8.6.71:Change:Ela 'Fold' trait renamed to 'Seq'.
0.8.6.70:Change:Type verification of pattern match is decomissioned. According to the language sematics all possible combinations of patterns are correct.
0.8.6.69:Change:All previous warnings and hints that were generates in a case when an irrefutable pattern was used before other patterns are decomissioned.
0.8.6.68:Change:MatchEntryAlwaysFail warning message now displays the pattern that will never match.
0.8.6.67:Change:MatchEntryTypingFailed error now made into warning.
0.8.6.66:New:Check for overlapping match entries is implemented (experimental).
0.8.6.65:Change:Pretty printer for Ela AST is completely redesigned to support indented output.
0.8.6.64:Fix:A bug in type check of patterns in pattern matching construct is fixed (string pattern and list pattern could be considered as invalid when this is a valid combination).
0.8.6.63:Change:Ela now doesn't have any special treatment for unary operators. They are treated in the same way as binary. Unary notiation is allowed using "partial application" syntax. It changes almost nothing with the only exception that unary operators can be called using postfix notation.
0.8.6.61:Change:Partial application for operators as well as operator referencing as functions now don't require braces.
0.8.6.60:Change:Keyword 'and' is not replaced by keyword 'et'.
0.8.6.59:Change:Now it is required to write function name before each function body.
0.8.6.58:Fix:Syntax for 'binding' pattern changed.
0.8.6.57:Fix:Now 'where' clause is correctly processed when it is attached to another 'where' clause (which e.g. is a regular variable binding).
0.8.6.56:Change:Multiple refactorings in Ela parser.
0.8.6.55:Fix:Multiple corrections in Ela parser error messages.
0.8.6.54:New:Now 'F' (or 'f') prefix is supported by Ela numeric literals to denote single precision floating numbers.
0.8.6.53:Fix:A critical error in compilation logic of comprehensions is fixed - multiple generators used to crash Ela machine.
0.8.6.52:Change:Now ForeignModule has a Close method that is called when Ela machine is disposed (Ela machine implements IDisposable for that and now it is mandatory to dispose it).
0.8.6.51:New:A sequencing operator '$' is now a function.
0.8.6.50:Change:Parsing rules for 'match' and 'try' expressions are changed. Now they are not 'simple' expressions anymore and cannot be used in function application without parenthesis.
0.8.6.49:Change:Minor enhancements in parser error reporting.
0.8.6.48:Fix:A bug in parser fixed - parser could crash if you try to use an operator as a function when an operator is not a function but is a special form.
0.8.6.47:New:Now Ela linker can accept files with no extension, files with .ela extension and files with .elaobj extension as primary module. It will always first try to read object file and only then - to compile a file.
0.8.6.46:Fix:An error in object file reader and writer is fixed that could cause a linker crush or incorrect module deserialization because of an error in they way how module references were processed.
0.8.6.45:Change:Ela supports optional "no layout" mode when semicolons are used as a replacement for indentation (will be useful in interactive mode).
0.8.6.44:Change:Ela now supports entering expressions directly at the top level.
0.8.6.43:Change:A new layout based syntax is implemented. Keyword 'end' is not longer required for 'let' and 'where' bindings (as well as for 'match' and 'try' expressions). Also semicolons are not required between match entries.
0.8.6.42:Fix:A bug in functional literal compilation logic fixed - it could cause stack corruption when used on a left side of an expression.
0.8.6.41:Fix:Parser could crush on a syntax error binding pattern.
0.8.6.40:Fix:A bug in range compilation logic fixed - it didn't take into account situations when range is used at the left hand side and as a result generate code could cause stack corruption.
0.8.6.39:Fix:A critical bug fixed in compilation logic of guards in pattern matching constructs.
0.8.6.38:Fix:A critical bug fixed in compilation logic of head/tail pattern.
0.8.6.37:Fix:Corrections in error message for 'TraitFieldSet' run time error.
0.8.6.36:Fix:A warning ELA400 (UnitAlwaysFail) could be generated in an incorrect case (when applying 'Eq' trait to unit which is legal).
0.8.6.35:Change:Now one can write expressions directly in the global scope.
0.8.6.34:Change:Syntax for 'module open' directive is changed from 'open Foo[dllname] as MyFoo with x,y' to 'open Foo#dllname@MyFoo with x,y'.
0.8.6.33:Fix:Minor fixes in implementation of 'Show' trait for ElaList.
0.8.6.32:Change:All imperative cycles including 'for-to', 'for-downto', 'for-in' and 'while' are decomissioned. Also 'return', 'break' and 'continue' keywords are removed.
0.8.6.31:Change:Syntax for mutable record fields changed from '{mutable x=...}' to '{!x=...}'.
0.8.6.30:Change:Strict compiler mode is decomissioned (it only enforced errors on global mutable variables which are useless as soon as there are no mutable variables at all).
0.8.6.29:Change:Ela doesn't support mutable variables anymore. One should use reference cells to achieve the same effect, e.g. '{!value=...}'.
0.8.6.28:Fix:Parse could crash on a binding expression without initialization block, e.g. 'let foo'.
0.8.6.27:Change:Minor corrections in compiler error messages.
0.8.6.26:Change:Multiple code refactorings in order to support .NET 2.0 as a minimum requirement (C# 3.0 is still a minimum version of compiler that is needed to build Ela projects).
0.8.6.25:New:Now ElaModule supports trait 'FieldGet'.
0.8.6.24:Change:Now printing infinite lists (using 'show' trait and built-in formatter helper) cannot cycle - looping through the list will always stop after first 50 elements. If one needs to show more elements than these elements should be explicitely taken from list before that ('take').
0.8.6.23:Change:Built-in function 'cout' (along with corresponding op code) is decomissioned. One should should use Con module for console output.
0.8.6.22:Change:ElaRecord fully refactored. Now it doesn't inherit ElaTuple. Also support for 'Ord' and 'Num' traits is dropped. However records still provide structural equality.
0.8.6.21:Change:Pattern matching in bindings ('let' and 'where') has changed. Now all patterns except of variant pattern can be used without extra parenthesis.
0.8.6.20:New:Trait 'Cons' extended with a 'Nil' method that can be used to get a 'nil' instance of an entity. Also a new built-in 'nil' function is added to is mapped to this action.
0.8.6.19:New:Not is is possible to create pervasives (such as custom operators) from foreign modules (modules written in .NET).
0.8.6.18:New:A new built-in function 'ref' added (along with new op code Ceqref). This function can be used to test two given object using reference equality.
0.8.6.17:Fix:A bug fixed in compilation logic of head/tail pattern for patterns that are combined from two nested patterns. A typical example of a case when this bug could be reproduced is when you have a head/tail pattern that ends with (xs@n) - in such as case 'n' variable wasn't declared at all.
0.8.6.16:Change:Trait 'Seq' renamed to 'Ix'.
0.8.6.15:New:A new public 'Concatenate' method added to ElaList (method can be used from .NET code to concatenate two lists).
0.8.6.14:Change:Ela reflection API is fully refactored.
0.8.6.13:New:Methods Left and Some added to ElaVariant to simplify construction of 'Either' variant (for operation in .NET code).
0.8.6.12:Change:Method for comparison (ElaObject.Compare) can now be overriden by the types defined outside of Ela core assembly.
0.8.6.11:Fix:Now ElaString supports 'Seq' trait (which supported by string as soon as it represents an ordered structure of elements).
0.8.6.10:Fix:Location information corrected for the literal patterns.
0.8.6.9:Fix:Pattern type check logic corrected in according to the recent type system changes (it used to generate errors for the correct cases).
0.8.6.8:Fix:Multiple corrections in Ela AST pretty printing logic.
0.8.6.7:New:Now all Ela types expose a GetTypeName method that is used internally by Ela machine to determine type name.
0.8.6.6:Change:Verification of function application at compile time is enhanced - it will now generate warning for all attempts to call something different than function if it was directly initialized with a literal.
0.8.6.5:Change:ElaArray now moved from the built-in types to the standard library. Arrcons op code, array literal, array pattern, etc. are decomissioned.
0.8.6.4:Change:'Tagval' op code renamed to 'Untag'.
0.8.6.3:Fix:'Tag' trait didn't have a full implementation. The direct casting to ElaVariant still took place for the 'untag' operation. A new 'Untag' method added to the trait 'Tag' to avoid this.
0.8.6.2:Change:FormatHelper class made public so it can be used when implementing 'Show' trait for custom types.
0.8.6.1:New:Now lazy lists can be fully used from .NET code - ElaList.Next correctly processes a situation when a list is lazy and forces thunk evaluation.
0.8.6.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.8.6
0.8.5.24:Fix:Module name wasn't preserved when using incremental linker (and as a result didn't show up in call stack).
0.8.5.23:Fix:A critical error in built-in 'flip' function fixed - it corrupted functions when applied to external functions.
0.8.5.22:Change:ElaCallException is decomissioned. Instead new ElaRuntimeException should be used by external methods (it allows to specify an exception category that is translated by Ela into variant tag).
0.8.5.21:New:Now Ela types implement 'Compare' method (which is exposed to public through implementation of IComparable<> interface in ElaValue).
0.8.5.20:New:A standard 'Equals' function is implemented in ElaValue (it delegates to 'Eq' trait implementation of a particular type).
0.8.5.19:New:A hashing function ('GetHashCode') is implemented for all Ela types where it is reasonable to have one.
0.8.5.18:Change:'Seq' trait makes its return. It is used to mark a type as a one that supports a sequential access to its elements (and is normally coupled with 'Get').
0.8.5.17:Change:Syntax of 'trait check' pattern is changed from '<Foo,Bar>' to '?(Foo,Bar)'.
0.8.5.16:Fix:Implementation of 'Eq' trait in ElaVariant now correctly processes a situation when both compared values are variants (previously a comparison like '`Foo 42 == `Bar 42' would result to 'true'.
0.8.5.15:Fix:Now ElaValue.FromObject doesn't fail if a provided value is a null reference. An ElaUnit value is used in such case.
0.8.5.14:Fix:Bug fix in a conversion method - a conversion used to fail when target and source types were the same.
0.8.5.13:New:ElaVariant now has static methods 'Some' and 'None' that simplify creation of Option-type variants.
0.8.5.12:New:Now ElaValue exposes all trait methods that can be used to operate with traits supported by a wrapped object.
0.8.5.11:Change:A 'Call' method that supports 'Call' trait made protected internal as all other trait methods.
0.8.5.10:New:A new 'Is<T>' and 'As<T>' methods added to ElaValue that can be used to test type of a wrapped object and convert it directly.
0.8.5.9:New:A 'ReferenceEquals' method added to ElaValue that can be used to perform fast reference comparison (without the need to convert to object first).
0.8.5.8:Fix:A bug in type conversion logic for ElaValue has fixed - it didn't correctly processes all the possible values for the target type and as a result conversion from ElaObject to a comparible type wasn't supported.
0.8.5.7:Fix:Now type conversion for ElaValue can correctly handle a situation when a requested conversion is from ElaValue to ElaValue.
0.8.5.6:Change:Type check pattern now has syntax '?typename' instead of 'x ? typename'. This syntax is used in all constructs, e.g. 'x is ?typename' (used to be 'x ? typename', the '?' operator was used for both 'short match' expression and type check pattern).
0.8.5.5:Change:Operator '?' is now replaced by 'is'.
0.8.5.4:Fix:Pretty printing is corrected for type check pattern when check is done against traits.
0.8.5.3:Change:A new 'Tag' trait added and now operations with polymorphic variants are performed through this trait.
0.8.5.2:Fix:Now Ela allows to use '[]' pattern in the middle of head/tail pattern (e.g. 'x[]xs'). This is a completely legal situation (nil list beign an element of another list) but was treated as an error.
0.8.5.1:Change:A built-in function 'ignore' is decomissioned.
0.8.5.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.8.5
0.8.4.12:Change:The syntax for comprehension is changed, now '\\' operator is used instead of '@', e.g. [x \\ x <- [1..10]].
0.8.4.11:New:Now ElaValue can be created from both arrays and IEnumerable implementations. The first creates ElaArray, the second - ElaList.
0.8.4.10:New:Now ElaValue.GetType method can convert Ela objects to arrays (in the same manner as to IEnumerable<>).
0.8.4.9:New:Now ElaValue.GetType method can convert Ela objects to IEnumerable<T> type where T can be a native .NET type (e.g. char or int). This also affect marshalling of data types performed by ForeignModule when registering delegates as Ela functions.
0.8.4.8:Change:Module 'open' directive syntax changed. Instead of 'open Foo at "Directory" with x' we have 'open Directory.Foo x'.
0.8.4.7:Fix:Module 'open' directive now correctly works in both Windows and Unix when a path element is specified.
0.8.4.6:Change:Minor cleanups and enhancements in parser error reporting logic.
0.8.4.5:Fix:The 'as' clause didn't work in 'open' module directive.
0.8.4.4:Fix:An incorrect warning could be generated for an expression like so 'x <- ()'.
0.8.4.3:Change:Now ToString in ElaObject prints '<unknown>' if a value cannot be determined (which happens for stack based values).
0.8.4.2:Fix:ElaRecord didn't correctly process a situation when one tried to use 'Gen' trait with it (it doesn't support Gen but error was raised).
0.8.4.1:New:Comprehension operator '@@' can now be used for ranges as well as for comprehensions.
0.8.4.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.8.4
0.8.3.7:New:Partial application (in the form '(@@ [x,x<-seq])') for the comprehension operator has added.
0.8.3.6:New:An ability to use guards (multiple, with mandatory 'else' guard) in 'let' and 'where' bindings added.
0.8.3.5:New:Now ElaString supports 'Cons' trait (can be constructed using list construction operator).
0.8.3.4:New:A comprehension operator '@@' is added. (With comprehension operator you can use comprehensions for any type that supports 'Gen' trait).
0.8.3.3:New:Now ElaLinker raises an exception when a module reference is used in sandbox mode.
0.8.3.2:Fix:A bug fixed in compilation logic of 'while true do...' expression. Invalid optimization for this pattern was causing VM to crush.
0.8.3.1:New:An ability to executed Ela scripts in a limited trust environment added. Now ElaLinker has a Sandbox option (disabled by default) that allows it.
0.8.3.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.8.3
0.8.2.10:Change:An internal type name for function is changed from 'function' to 'fun'.
0.8.2.9:Fix:Syntax in the form 'x * -y' is now recognized as invalid (the correct one is 'x * -y').
0.8.2.8:Fix:Self reference in variable declaration was always allowed for regular declarations as well that could cause VM to crush in certain cases.
0.8.2.7:New:A new public Convert method that accepts ObjectType and execution context added to ElaValue.
0.8.2.6:New:Now ElaFunction supports a set of static Create method that allow to create an Ela function from Func<> delegates.
0.8.2.5:Fix:Linker didn't scan files in the folder where 'elac.exe' is located.
0.8.2.4:Fix:Local binding using 'where' didn't always create a lexical scope.
0.8.2.3:Fix:A bug in implementation of 'length' function for lists is fixed - it could crash in a case of lazy lists or cycle forever.
0.8.2.2:Fix:A bug fixed in enumeration of lazy lists.
0.8.2.1:Fix:A bug fixed in parser that could case parser to crash in semantic action for a match entry with guards.
0.8.2.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.8.2
0.8.1.7:Change:A 'Seq' trait is decomissioned.
0.8.1.6:New:An ability to test if a given value supports specified traits is added to pattern matching, i.e. 'x ? <Num,Eq>').
0.8.1.5:Fix:Operations 'succ' and 'pred' didn't work correctly with 'tuples' - the length of a result tuple wasn't calculated correctly.
0.8.1.4:Fix:Negation ('Neg' op code) operation didn't work correctly for 'single' data type.
0.8.1.3:New:Now string support 'Ord' trait - comparison operations such as greater, lesser, etc.
0.8.1.2:Fix:Minor fixes in 'match' pretty printing logic.
0.8.1.1:Fix:Now 'end' is required for the 'where' construct. Logic that allowed to omit it in certain cases caused error prone code.
0.8.1.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.8.1
0.8.0.21:Fix:A bug in 'lazy' data type behavior when it acts as a tail of a lazy list is fixed (this bug was reproducible on certain types of lazy lists).
0.8.0.20:Fix:A bug in enumeration of certain types of lazy lists is fixed.
0.8.0.19:Fix:A bug fixed in compiler that could cause compiler to crush when an initialization is missing in a variable declaration (should result in a regular error message instead).
0.8.0.18:Fix:A bug fixed in error formatting code in Ela Console that could cause console to crush in certain cases.
0.8.0.17:New:Now all record fields are immutable by default. To declare a mutable field one should write 'mutable', i.e. '{mutable x = 0}'.
0.8.0.16:Fix:A critical bug in stack size calculation fixed - compilation logic for the head/tail pattern is rewritten.
0.8.0.15:New:Now types 'single' and 'double' support 'Enum' trait (successor/predecessor operations).
0.8.0.14:Change:'Arrcons', 'Tupcons' and 'Lrev' op codes are decomissioned. Now new op codes 'Gen' and 'Genfin' (to finalize generation) are used instead for all data structures. A new trait 'Gen' is added to support it.
0.8.0.13:Change:Compilation logic for comprehensions and ranges is refactored and now is more generic.
0.8.0.12:Change:Parsing logic for comprehensions and their representation in Ela DOM is redesigned.
0.8.0.11:Change:Serialization to string of tuples is changed for the case of single element tuples, now a comma is added at the end to match literal and to denote that this a tuple, not just grouped expression.
0.8.0.10:Fix:A bug fixed in implementation of 'pred' trait for integers (used to work in the same manner as 'succ').
0.8.0.9:New:Now type 'char' supports trait 'Ord' (comparison operations - greater, lesser, etc.).
0.8.0.8:Change:Implementation of 'Show' trait in variant is corrected and now prints only the tag if it was created without the tagged value like so `None.
0.8.0.7:New:A new 'Thunk' trait added. Now Ela 'lazy' type implements this trait and operations with lazy (force) are not hardcoded for the particular type, but for the trait (now once can implement his own lazy type).
0.8.0.6:Fix:Correction in output of value in runtime error message (in certain case the value wasn't printed).
0.8.0.5:Change:Now the name of 'memory' module (in interactive mode) is always printed in brakets like so '<memory>' when an error is printed to output.
0.8.0.4:Fix:Minor corrections in Ela compiler error messages.
0.8.0.3:New:ForeignModule now supports delegates from Func family through methods like Add(string name,Func<T1,T2> fun).
0.8.0.2:Change:Now ElaValue generate standard InvalidCastException instead of ElaCastException. ElaParameterTypeException is decomissioned as well.
0.8.0.1:New:A generic ChangeType method added to ElaValue. This method can be used for conversions.
0.8.0.0:Release:Release of Ela 0.8
0.7.20.134:New:Now it is possible to use negative integers and reals in literal patterns like so '--1' or '--.25'.
0.7.20.133:Change:Now it is not possible to declare a cycle variable as mutable (e.g. for let mutable x in...). The cycle variables are still kind of mutable but their value is changed only by the cycle itself. (Basically you can notice this only if you capture this variable using closure).
0.7.20.132:Fix:A bug fixed in partial application of functions using 'operator' syntax.
0.7.20.131:New:A pretty printing functionality is added to Ela AST. Some of the compiler error message now shows the body of an errorneous expression.
0.7.20.130:Change:Now Ela allows to declare custom operators with any number of arguments (they can be called in infix, prefix and postfix forms).
0.7.20.129:Change:Parser error reporting logic is refactored and enhanced.
0.7.20.128:Fix:Traits 'Cont' and 'Insert' used to define a mutable container such as ElaArray are removed as welll as corresponding built-ins and op codes. Now ElaArray directly exposes functions to operate with its contents like it used before.
0.7.20.127:New:Variant types are fully refactored. Now variant is a type that holds a tag and an instance of an object of any other type. It provide transparent operations with the wrapped object, e.g. you can write '`Some 3 + 5' and this will be a perfectly valid code with the result '8'. Pattern matching for variants is refactored as well.
0.7.20.126:New:'Show' trait now supports format strings (all numeric types implement them). Also new built-ins 'show' (with default format) and 'showf' (with a format as a first argument) are added with corresponding op codes.
0.7.20.125:Change:Unary minus and 'bitwise not' are now normal unary operators with their own precedence (less tight than function application). Partial application is also supported. Functions 'negate' and 'bitnot' are decomissioned.
0.7.20.124:Change:Compilation logic for pipe operators is fully refactored. Now these operators a not functions but a pure syntax and only exist in parse time and are translated to regular function application AST node.
0.7.20.123:Fix:Validation logic for PM as a function definition (check whether patterns for all function parameters are provided) is corrected. It didn't recognize errorneous situations in some cases.
0.7.20.122:Change:Guards expressions (PM without patterns and 'match with' block) are (probably temporary) decomissioned.
0.7.20.121:Fix:A bug in compilation logic of head/tail pattern was fixed. This bug could cause stack corruption (unused data could be left on a stack).
0.7.20.120:Change:Do/end expression decomissioned. One shoudl use sequencing operator '$' instead.
0.7.20.119:Change:Cycles now no longer can be used as the comprehension syntax.
0.7.20.118:Change:Mutable variable declaration syntax changed from "var x = ..." to "let mutable x = ...".
0.7.20.117:Change:The 'or' pattern (written using '||' operator) is now decomissioned. One can use closures to achieve the similar effect.
0.7.20.116:New:Now it is possible to use string literals when specifying record field names in record pattern.
0.7.20.115:Fix:A bug fixed in code for cloning external function (an array that holds partially applied parameters wasn't cloned and a new function copy used the pointer to the same array).
0.7.20.114:Fix:A bug fixed in compilation logic of 'if' expression (wrong lexical scoping, both 'if' and 'else' clauses had the same lexical scope which could cause VM to crush in some rare cases).
0.7.20.113:New:Now one can use string literal to specify field names in record literal if a field name doesn't comply with identifier rules, e.g. {"text-decoration"="underline"}.
0.7.20.112:Change:A 'field test' pattern (the one that doesn't binding a value of record field but simply checks if this field is present) is decomissioned.
0.7.20.111:Change:Compilation logic for record patterns is refactored.
0.7.20.110:Change:Now 'where' binding support function definition by PM and multiple binding using 'and' but has a required 'end' terminator.
0.7.20.109:New:A new 'Call' trait is implemented (this trait is supported by 'function' data type).
0.7.20.108:New:An ability to reload an opened module added to Ela linker and VM (this feature is used by interactive console).
0.7.20.107:Change:Ela VM and type system are seriously refactored to gain a better type flexibility. Also performance is tuned for certain cases.
0.7.20.106:Change:'Eq' trait now has both methods Equals and NotEquals. 'Ord' traits now have methods additional methods 'GreaterEquals' and 'LesserEquals'.
0.7.20.105:Change:Now most of trait operations return 'ElaValue' and not a concrete value, e.g. Equals, Greater, etc. return ElaValue, not a boolean value as they used to. One can use 'Bool' trait to obtain boolean.
0.7.20.104:Change:'Invalid' type is decomissioned and is no longer used internally by VM to signal an incorrect operation.
0.7.20.103:Change:The 'Show' trait is extended with extendable ShowInfo structure that can be used to provide display options.
0.7.20.102:Change:Now Ela supports only implicit conversion from int to long and from single to double, int to double, long to single, etc. are prohibited.
0.7.20.101:Change:The 'traits' system is fully refactored. Now all binary operations accept two parameters for both left and right operands - now expressions 'Foo + x' and 'x + Foo' will have the same result type.
0.7.20.100:New:A lazy list comprehension is implemented that can be used to generate lazy linked lists using the same syntax as with regular lists comprehensions.
0.7.20.99:New:Now tuples support comparisons (based on their elements), arithmetic and bitwise operations.
0.7.20.98:New:A new 'where' binding implemented (in Haskell style). This binding can be scoped to guards and can be quite useful in pattern matching.
0.7.20.97:Change:Now lambdas support guards but don't support multiple body definition.
0.7.20.96:New:Guards syntax has changed and guards are enhanced - now they can be used in PM without patterns (in such case either the previous pattern is considered or none). Match compilation logic has changed to support this.
0.7.20.95:New:A new 'Lazycall' op code added that is used to optimize lazy values creation and execution when a body of a lazy value is a function application.
0.7.20.94:Change:Op codes 'Brptr' and 'Pushptr' are removed a long with the special stack 'pointer' data type as soon as these staff is no longer needed by Ela interpreter.
0.7.20.93:New:Now it is possible to use guards in method formal parameter list.
0.7.20.92:New:Ranges in Haskell style added (including support for infinite lists).
0.7.20.91:Fix:Ela op code deserialization logic was incorrect and caused linker to crush.
0.7.20.90:Fix:A logic for verification of date stamps of Ela object files (in Ela linker) was incorrect and generated a warning when it wasn't needed.
0.7.20.89:Fix:A bug fixed in interactive mode - user defined operators didn't work at in incremental compilation mode.
0.7.20.88:New:A new 'Trait' op code is added that allow to check whether an object support provided traits.
0.7.20.87:New:A new 'Tag' trait is added that potentially allows other data types (not only records and tuples) to be 'tagged'.
0.7.20.86:Change:Implementation of polymorphic variants has changed. Now variant constructors are not literals but functions. In fact a 'tag' built-in function that accepts a string tag and an object is used for construction of variants. Older syntax is just a sugar for it - e.g. `Some (x, y) is equivalent to tag "Some" (x, y). Constructors for variants are also removed from the language. Now regular functions can be used to construct variants with the same success.
0.7.20.85:New:Compilation of simple cases for the pattern head/tail (which are the most common cases) is seriously optmized. New op codes are used for this - 'Skiptl' and 'Skiptn'.
0.7.20.84:Change:Module 'open' expressions can be used only as top level expressions.
0.7.20.83:New:An alternative (closer to Set-Builder notation) list and array comprehension syntax added.
0.7.20.82:Change:Now for expression and while expression use a do/end block as their body therefore the 'end' token is required for them.
0.7.20.81:Change:Now a global scope can either contains a single expression (can be useful in interactive mode) or only let/do expressions. All other expressions are prohibited. Semicolons are no longer used to separate declarations. The only place where semicolons can be used are do/end expressions.
0.7.20.80:Change:Do/while and until expressions are removed. Also unless expression (a version of when expression) is removed.
0.7.20.79:Change:A new do/end expression is introduced to simplify writing imperative code. Expressions inside do/end block should be separated with semicolons. This construct doesn not define a lexical scope.
0.7.20.78:New:A support for lazy lists is added. Now lists allow to have a 'thunk' as a next element. Therefore a second argument of a cons operator can simply contains a lazy value.
0.7.20.77:Change:Generator function (or so called 'static functions') are fully removed from the language along with 'Newfuns', 'Callcc', 'Checkcc', 'Yield' and many other related op codes. Also built-in functions 'iter' and 'next' are removed and for/in construct is rewritten to use 'Fold' trait.
0.7.20.76:New:Ela reflection API is refactored according to the new changes in Ela object model. Exceptions are now records with a 'Type' tag.
0.7.20.75:New:A new 'Convert' trait is added that can be used to control how objects convert to each other.
0.7.20.74:Change:Conversion routine is again refactored. Now ElaValue doesn't implement IConvertible but defines methods that exactly corresponds to Ela types and perform exact type marshalling and no conversion.
0.7.20.73:New:A new 'Show' trait that controls formatting of objects to a string added. Now string conversion and string representation are two different things.
0.7.20.72:New:ElaArray now implements 'Fold' trait and can be analysed using pattern matching (specifically head/tail pattern).
0.7.20.71:New:A new 'Fold' and 'Cons' traits are added that allow to fully similate linked lists by other data structures.
0.7.20.70:New:A new exception handling mechanism for objects that support traits is implemented. Exception handling is done through the ExecutionContext instance and allows to preserve full stack trace if an error object originates from the Ela code (e.g. executed in another worker thread).
0.7.20.69:Change:Now all virtual machine operations are based on traits, including atomic operations such as 'add', 'sub', 'del' and more complex operations.
0.7.20.68:Change:New built-in functions 'add', 'remove', 'clear' and 'insert' are added instead of built-in functions of array. These new functions however are polymorphic.
0.7.20.67:Change:Ela object model fully refactored. A new 'traits' concept is introduced. All standard functions are groups into categories (traits) and external objects can fully extend object model and can be used with Ela standard operators. Now objects don't have any built-in attributes at all.
0.7.20.66:Change:Calculation of lazy values is refactored.
0.7.20.65:Change:'Typeid' op code now checks if a value is unevaluated lazy and pushes lazy type ID, if it is an evaluated lazy and pushes ID of an actual value or acts as normal in other case.
0.7.20.64:New:A new 'force' built-in function (and corresponding 'Force' op code) added that can be used to explicitly force lazy values.
0.7.20.63:Change:Functions id, sub, key and rec are no longer built-in. They will be moved to the library.
0.7.20.62:New:An 'AmbiguousUnary' parser error added that rejects expressions in the form 'n-1' (without spaces). Previously they were considered to be function applications.
0.7.20.61:Fix:Compilation logic for list pattern is fixed (it worked correctly only for the first two elements).
0.7.20.60:Fix:Comprehension compilation logic fixed (nested comprehensions didn't work correctly).
0.7.20.59:Fix:A bug fixed in compilation logic of variants and in compilation logic of variants call.
0.7.20.58:New:A shortcut syntax for record pattern is now available, one can write '{foo}' as an equivalent to '{foo=foo}'.
0.7.20.57:Fix:A bug in indexer logic of lists is fixed.
0.7.20.56:Fix:Now compiler disallows implicit tupling of function arguments when PM is used in function definition and an irrefutable pattern (such as 'x') is specified while not providing the full argument list. This behavior could cause unintuitive runtime errors.
0.7.20.55:Fix:A bug fixed in comparison logic ('Br_eq' and 'Br_neq') of boolean values.
0.7.20.54:Change:Now each function has its own stack which size is defined statically, therefore the need to dynamically check and resize stack is eleminated which causes noticeable performance improvements.
0.7.20.53:New:Now Ela compiler statically calculates the size of the stack for functions and global scope.
